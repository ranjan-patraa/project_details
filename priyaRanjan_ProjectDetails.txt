In the Shephora ESB migration project, we transitioned existing web service integrations to a scalable cloud architecture using Azure services, addressing challenges like limited scalability and high maintenance costs. My role involved analyzing existing web methods, refactoring code for Azure Functions, and orchestrating the migration of interfaces to Azure Logic Apps for automation, with data securely stored in Azure Storage Accounts. We adopted an incremental migration strategy to minimize disruption, using Azure Service Bus to manage service dependencies effectively. The project resulted in improved scalability and reduced operational costs, with enhanced monitoring capabilities via Azure Monitor enabling proactive issue resolution. This experience deepened my understanding of cloud architecture and Azure tools, while also enhancing my skills in communication and collaboration with cross-functional teams.
